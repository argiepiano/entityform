Entityform
---------------------


The Entityform module enables the user to create front-end forms (fieldable
entities), which contain fields that can be defined. These forms use the
standard Backdrop fields. This means that out of the box, the user can use any
standard Backdrop node field.


Installation
------------

Install the Entityform module as you would normally install a contributed
Backdrop module.


Configuration
--------------

    1. Navigate to Administration > Modules and enable the Entityform module and
       its dependencies.
    2. Navigate to entity the administration interface under Administration >
       Content > Entityform Types and "Add an Entityform Type".
    3. Fill out basic form information. Under Access Settings make sure at least
       one role can submit the form. Select "Save Entityform Type".
    4. Select manage fields and add fields the same fashion as a node content
       type.
    5. Once the user has added fields the user can view the form by selecting
       the Submit Link on Administration > Structure > Entity Form Types.
